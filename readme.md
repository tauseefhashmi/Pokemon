
## Portfolio Highlights üöÄ
- Built a complete **ETL pipeline** in Python to fetch, transform, and store Pok√©mon data from a public API.
- Designed a **normalized relational database schema** (Pok√©mon, types, abilities, stats, evolutions) in SQLite.
- Implemented **robust API handling** with retries and error handling for reliable data fetching.
- Modular, clean, and maintainable Python code with CLI for flexible usage.
- Ready for extension: could add Docker, GraphQL API, or interactive front-end.


# Pok√©Pipeline üêæ

**A data pipeline that fetches, transforms, and stores Pok√©mon data from the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) into a relational SQLite database.**  

This project demonstrates building a complete ETL pipeline, handling nested JSON data, designing a normalized database schema, and storing structured data for easy querying.

---

## Project Overview
Pok√©Pipeline extracts Pok√©mon data from the **PokeAPI**, transforms nested API responses into a relational format, and loads it into an **SQLite database**.  

Key entities include:
- Pok√©mon basic info (name, height, weight, base experience)  
- Types  
- Abilities  
- Stats  
- Evolution chain  

The pipeline is modular, Pythonic, and **Windows 11 ready**, making it easy to run and inspect the stored data.

---

## Features
- Fetch Pok√©mon data for specific IDs or ranges (default: first 20 Pok√©mon).  
- Transform raw JSON into normalized relational data.  
- Store data in **SQLite**, including relationships between Pok√©mon, types, abilities, stats, and evolutions.  
- Robust API handling with retries and error logging.  
- Modular Python functions for easy extension.

## Database Schema
| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pokemon` | Stores basic info for each Pok√©mon, including evolution chain reference. |
| `types` | Master table of Pok√©mon types. |
| `pokemon_types` | Many-to-many mapping between Pok√©mon and their types. |
| `abilities` | Master table of abilities. |
| `pokemon_abilities` | Many-to-many mapping between Pok√©mon and abilities, with hidden/slot info. |
| `stats` | Stores each Pok√©mon‚Äôs base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.). |
| `evolutions` | Maps evolution relationships between Pok√©mon. |

## Database Relationships (ER Diagram)
- `pokemon` ‚¨å `pokemon_types` ‚¨å `types`  
  (Many-to-many: A Pok√©mon can have multiple types)
- `pokemon` ‚¨å `pokemon_abilities` ‚¨å `abilities`  
  (Many-to-many: A Pok√©mon can have multiple abilities)
- `pokemon` ‚¨å `stats`  
  (One-to-many: Each Pok√©mon has multiple stats)
- `pokemon` ‚¨å `evolutions` ‚¨å `pokemon`  
  (Self-referential Many-to-many: Represents evolution relationships)

## Setup & Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- `requests` library  
- SQLite (built-in with Python)  

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokepipeline.git
cd pokepipeline
```
2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```
3.The pipeline uses SQLite by default ‚Äî no additional installation is required.

### Usage
1.Run the pipeline with default first 20 Pok√©mon:
```
python pokepipeline.py
```
2.Fetch specific Pok√©mon IDs:
```
python pokepipeline.py --ids 1 4 7
```
3.Fetch a range of Pok√©mon:
```
python pokepipeline.py --start-id 1 --end-id 20
```
Optional: specify a custom database path:
```
python pokepipeline.py --db "C:/Users/YourUser/pokemon.db"
```

## Viewing Stored Data

1.Option A: SQLite CLI
```
sqlite3 pokemon.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM pokemon LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM types LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM abilities LIMIT 5;
.exit
```
2. Option B: Python
```
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("pokemon.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM pokemon LIMIT 5")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)
conn.close()
```

## Design Choices

- Normalized schema: Separate tables for Pok√©mon, types, abilities, stats, and evolutions.
- ETL modularity: Functions separated into extraction, transformation, and loading.
- SQLite: Chosen for simplicity and portability. Easy to switch to PostgreSQL.
- Error handling: API requests have retry logic with exponential backoff.
- Flexibility: CLI arguments allow fetching specific Pok√©mon IDs or ranges.

## Assumptions

- Evolution chain IDs are derived from species data URLs.
- Pok√©mon with missing API fields are skipped or stored with NULL where appropriate.
- Only the first 20 Pok√©mon are fetched by default for demo purposes.

## Potential Improvements

- Database: Switch to PostgreSQL for production-grade storage.
- API caching: Avoid repeated calls to PokeAPI.
- Front-end: Simple web UI to view Pok√©mon and filter/search by type or ability.
- GraphQL endpoint: Expose transformed Pok√©mon data via API.
- Docker: Containerize pipeline for easy deployment.
- Automated tests: Unit tests for extraction, transformation, and loading steps.
